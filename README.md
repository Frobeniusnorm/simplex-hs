# simplex-hs
Simple implementations of various variants of the simplex algorithm in Haskell with [hmatrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix-0.20.2).

## Many implementations (i.e. all) are horrible inefficient, this project is just a "learning + hobby" project. Read if you are interested in the implementation in haskell, but do not use in anything serious! ##
